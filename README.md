# NYC2024MarathonAnalysis

## Project Goal:
This project aims to explore the demographics and performance metrics of the NYC 2024 Marathon. By examining a variety of factors—from age and gender to pace and overall finishing time—the analysis seeks to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can help us better understand the population of marathon runners and the factors that influence their performance in one of the largest marathons in the world.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was discovered through the Data is Plural weekly newsletter, which provides readers with unique and intriguing datasets from around the web. For this analysis, the marathon results were obtained from the following sources:
  * https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2024-11-13-edition/
  * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_zxndHKhKMIfJ9e7_M5L7b4F3S__d1nVnUS8iZn8yE/edit?gid=823797431#gid=823797431

## Data Analysis Overview
In this project, we perform an in-depth analysis of the marathon data by:
  - Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure accurate and meaningful insights.
  - Visualizing key distributions, such as overall finishing times and pace distributions.
  - Exploring relationships between demographics (e.g., age, gender) and performance metrics.
  - Highlighting trends and anomalies to better understand how different factors contribute to marathon performance.

This analysis not only sheds light on the performance dynamics of NYC marathon runners but also provides a framework for applying data science techniques to sports analytics.
